SpatialPy is a Python 3 package for simulation of spatial deterministic/stochastic reaction-diffusion-advection problems embedded in Lagrangian reference frame particle based fluid dynamics domain

This package is intended to replace the PyURDME software https://github.com/pyurdme/pyurdme and will feature both a NSM solver for RDME simulation on static domains and a sSSA-SDPD particle based fluid dynamics solver as described in the publication "A hybrid smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) spatial stochastic simulation algorithm (sSSA) for advection–diffusion–reaction problems" by Drawert, Jacob, Li, Yi, Petzold https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307101
