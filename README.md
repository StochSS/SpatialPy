# SpatialPy
Simulation of spatial deterministic/stochastic reaction-diffusion-advection problems embedded in Lagrangian reference frame particle based fluid dynamics domain

This package is intended to replace the PyURDME software https://github.com/pyurdme/pyurdme with the sSSA-SDPD particle based fluid dynamics as described in the publication "A hybrid smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) spatial stochastic simulation algorithm (sSSA) for advection–diffusion–reaction problems" by Drawert, Jacob, Li, Yi, Petzold https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307101
