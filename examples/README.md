Examples of using SpatialPy
===========================

The files in this directory are runnable Python examples of using [SpatialPy](https://github.com/StochSS/SpatialPy) to perform spatial deterministic/stochastic reaction-diffusion-advection simulations.  In terms of biology, they are overly simplistic and do not capture the real-life complexity of the process being modeled &ndash; the aim is not biological realism but rather to illustrate basic usage of [SpatialPy](https://github.com/StochSS/SpatialPy).

* [Start Here](Start_Here.ipynb) &ndash; a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) demonstrating the use of SpatialPy on a simple spatial Birth Death model.

* [3D Cylinder Demo](3D_Cylinder_Demo.ipynb) &ndash; a [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) demonstrating reaction diffusion simulations using SpatialPy.

* [Gravity](Gravity.ipynb) and [Weir](Weir.ipynb) &ndash; are [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) demonstrating fluid dynamics simulations using SpatialPy.
