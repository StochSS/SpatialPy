Test usage of the experimental ADFSP solver
PyURDME includes the ADFSP (Adaptive Diffusive Finite State Projection) solver. This solver integrates the Reaction-Diffusion Master Equations using the DFSP algorithm found in [Drawert et al., J.Chem.Phys, 2010] using an adaptive timesteping schemed based on the estimating the operator splitting error using the method from [Hellander et al., J.Comp.Phys, 2013].
